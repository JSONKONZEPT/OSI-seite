    <h1>The Seven Layers of OSI</h1>
</header>


<div class="layer-7"><p> Application Layer</p>
    <div class="dropdown-layer-7">
        <p class="info">
            The application layer provides full end-user access to a variety of shared network services for
            efficient OSI model data flow. This layer has many responsibilities, including error handling and recovery,
            data flow over a network and full network flow. It is also used to develop network-based applications.
            More than 15 protocols are used in the application layer, including File Transfer Protocol, Telnet, Trivial
            File Transfer Protocol and Simple Network Management Protocol.
            Its major network device or component is the gateway.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="layer-6"><p> Presentation Layer</p>
    <div class="dropdown-layer-6">
        <p class="info">
            The presentation layer mainly translates data between the application layer and the network format. Data can
            be
            communicated in different formats via different sources. Thus, the presentation layer is responsible for
            integrating all formats into a standard format for efficient and effective communication.
            The presentation layer follows data programming structure schemes developed for different languages and
            provides
            the real-time syntax required for communication between two objects such as layers, systems or networks. The
            data format should be acceptable by the next layers; otherwise, the presentation layer may not perform
            correctly.
            Network devices or components used by the presentation layer include redirectors and gateways.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="layer-5"><p> Session Layer</p>
    <div class="dropdown-layer-5">
        <p class="info">
            The session layer manages a session by initiating the opening and closing of sessions between end-user
            application processes. This layer also controls single or multiple connections for each end-user
            application, and directly communicates with both the presentation and the transport layers. The services
            offered by the session layer are generally implemented in application environments using remote procedure
            calls (RPCs).

        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="layer-4"><p> Transport Layer</p>
    <div class="dropdown-layer-4">
        <p class="info">
            Transport layers work transparently within the layers above to deliver and receive data without errors. The
            send side breaks application messages into segments and passes them on to the network layer. The receiving
            side then reassembles segments into messages and passes them to the application layer.
        </p>
    </div>

</div>
<div class="layer-3"><p> Network Layer</p>
    <div class="dropdown-layer-3">
        <p class="info">

            The network layer is considered the backbone of the OSI Model. It selects and manages the best logical path
            for data transfer between nodes. This layer contains hardware devices such as routers, bridges, firewalls
            and switches, but it actually creates a logical image of the most efficient communication route and
            implements it with a physical medium.

            Network layer protocols exist in every host or router. The router examines the header fields of all the IP
            packets that pass through it.

            Internet Protocol and Netware IPX/SPX are the most common protocols associated with the network layer.

            In the OSI model, the network layer responds to requests from the layer above it (transport layer) and
            issues requests to the layer below it (data link layer).

</div>
<div class="layer-2"><p> Data Link Layer</p>
    <div class="dropdown-layer-2">
        <p class="info">
            The data link layer frame includes source and destination addresses, data length, start signal or indicator
            and other related Ethernet information to enhance communication. This layer's main responsibility is to
            transfer data frames between nodes over a network.
        </p>
    </div>

</div>
<div class="layer-1"><p> Physical Layer</p>

    <div class="dropdown-layer-1">
        <p class="info">
            The physical layer is aimed at consolidating the hardware requirements of a network to enable the successful
            transmission of data. Network engineers can define different bit-transmission mechanisms for the physical
            layer level, including the shapes and types of connectors, cables, and frequencies for each physical medium.

            The physical layer sometimes plays an important role in the effective sharing of available communication
            resources, and helps avoid contention among multiple users. It also handles the transmission rate to improve
            the flow of data between a sender and receiver.
